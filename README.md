# nifty-launcher

Just another application launcher. Looks something like this:

## Why?

The primary gimmick of Nifty is that it's configured via Javascript file instead of configuration file. See `example/`.

The real reason I made Nifty is that I don't really like any existing launchers!


## How to run it

Install [nwjs](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) however you like

```
npm i
nw . -- ./example/example.js
```
